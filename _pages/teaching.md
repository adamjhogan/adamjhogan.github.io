## Teaching Philosophy
It is an honor and a responsibility to equip the next generation of audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and linguists with the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute to research and to provide culturally responsive evidence-based practice. To do so, we must encourage academic literacy and a commitment to lifelong learning. My teaching is motivated by that imperative while also understanding the human side of tomorrow's researchers and clinicians. I strive to make connections with my students, to encourage their passions, and to create an environment in which they feel supported to struggle through the initial stages of learning to emerge as budding experts.

## Course Evaluations
In the era of web-based course evaluations, only a subset of the students in my courses provide feedback. From Fall 2021 to Fall 2024, my average response rate was 33% (*Range*: 21-49%). Such a response rate means that [my course evaluations](/assets/Hogan_Teaching_Evaluations.pdf) are unlikely to reflect the opinions of all of the 297 students that I taught during that time period. Caveat aside, they may provide an overview of at least some of what students have thought about my teaching since Fall 2021.
