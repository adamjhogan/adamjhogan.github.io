I am a Ph.D. candidate at Louisiana State University studying speech perception and production among monolingual and bilingual populations. My special interest is in the perception of lexical stress and its utility for lexical access.

My current research addresses factors influencing the perception of lexical stress including language background and non-linguistic abilities such as music training.
