This study will involve the completion of a background questionnaire and repeating English
words. Your responses will be recorded using an audio recorder. We anticipate that this
experiment will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. All testing will take place in a sound
booth in the basement of Hatcher Hall. Participants who are currently students at Louisiana State
University will receive a voucher for extra credit to be used in the course of their choosing.
If you chose not to participate, you may earn extra credit by reading a research article related to
lexical stress and providing a 300-word summary.
